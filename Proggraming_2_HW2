Exercise 1 – Account class:
Design a class named Account that contains:
A private int data field named id for the account 
A private double data field named balance for the account 
A private Date data field named dateCreated that stores the date when the account was created
A no-arg constructor that creates a default account
A constructor that creates an account with the specified id and initial balance
The getters (i.e., accessors) and setters (i.e., mutators) methods for id and balance
The getter method for dateCreated
A method named withdraw that withdraws a specified amount from the account
A method named deposit that deposits a specified amount to the account



Exercise 2 – TestAccount class:
Write a test program named TestAccount that performs the following:
Create an Account object with an account ID of 1122 and a balance of 20,000 S.R. 
Use the withdraw method to withdraw 2,500 S.R.
Use the deposit method to deposit 3,000 S.R.
Print the balance and the date when this account was created

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution Exercise 1 (Account class) :

import java.util.Date;
public class Account{
 
 private int id = 0;
 private double balance = 0;
 private Date dateCreated;
 public Account(){
 dateCreated = new Date();
 }
 public Account(int id, double initialBalance){
 this.id = id;
 this.balance = initialBalance;
 dateCreated = new Date(); 
 }
 public void setId(int id){
 this.id = id;
 }
 public void setBalance(double balance){
 this.balance = balance;
 }
 public int getId(){
 return this.id;
 }
 public double getBalance(){
 return this.balance;
 }
 public Date getDateCreated(){
 return this.dateCreated;
 }
 public void withdraw(double takeMoney){
 this.balance = balance - takeMoney;
 }
 public void deposit(double addMoney){
 this.balance = balance + addMoney;
   }
 
}




Solution Exercise 2 (TestAccount class) :

import java.util.Scanner;
public class TestAccount {
 
 public static void main(String[] args){
 
 Account account = new Account(1122, 20000);
 
 account.withdraw(2500);
 account.deposit(3000);
 System.out.println("Balance is "+ 
account.getBalance());
 System.out.println("This account was created at "+ 
account.getDateCreated());

     }
 }
