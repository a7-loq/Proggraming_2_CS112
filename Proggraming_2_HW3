Proggraming_2_HW3

Exercise 1 :

In HW2 , the Account class was defined to model a bank account. 
An account has the properties account number, balance, a
nd date created, and methods to deposit and withdraw funds:
Create two subclasses for checking and saving accounts.
A checking account has an overdraft limit, but a savings account cannot be overdrawn.
Draw the UML diagram for the classes and then implement them. 
Write a test program that creates objects of Account, SavingsAccount, 
and CheckingAccount and invokes their toString() methods.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution Exercise 1 :

public class SavingsAccount extends Account {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
}
 protected double OVERDRAFT_LIMIT = 0;
 public SavingsAccount(int id, double balance) {
 super(id, balance);
 }
 public void withdraw(double amount) {
 double mBalance = 0;
if (mBalance - amount >= OVERDRAFT_LIMIT) {
 super.withdraw(amount);
 }
 }
 public String toString() {
 String mBalance = null;
return "SavingsAccount{" +
 "mBalance=" + mBalance +
 
 '}';
 
 } 
}
